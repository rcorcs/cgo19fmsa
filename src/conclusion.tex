\section{Conclusion}

We have presented a novel technique, based on sequence alignment, for merging
functions that addresses major limitations of the existing solutions.
We have also proposed a ranking-based exploration mechanism so that we can focus
the optimization on promising pairs of functions, reducing considerably the
compilation-time overhead, compared to the oracle's quadratic exploration.
With this framework, our 
optimization is able to reduce code size by up to 22\%, with an overall average
of about 5.6\%, while introducing an average compilation-time overhead of only 20\%.
%prototype introduces an average
%compilation-time overhead of only 20\%.
%Our optimization shows code-size reductions up to 22\%, with an overall average
%of about 5.6\%.
This optimization can be carried on without any significant impact on
performance when profiling information is used.

%%TODO:camera-ready
%For future work, we plan to focus on improving the ranking mechanism to reduce
%compilation time even further.
%A better compilation time can also be achieved by integrating the
%function-merging optimization to a summary-based parallel link-time optimization
%framework, such as ThinLTO in LLVM.
%We also plan to work on the linearization of the candidate functions, allowing
%instruction reordering to maximize the number of matches between the functions.
