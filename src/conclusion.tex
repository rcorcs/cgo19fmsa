\section{Conclusion}

We introduced a novel technique, based on sequence alignment, for reducing
code size by merging arbitrary functions. Our approach does not suffer from
any of the major limitations of existing solutions, outperforming them by more
than 3$\times$. We also proposed a ranking-based
exploration mechanism to focus the optimization on promising pairs of
functions. Ranking reduces the compilation-time overhead by orders of magnitude
compared to an exhaustive quadratic exploration. With this framework, our
optimization is able to reduce code size by up to 22\%, with an overall average
of about 5.6\%, while introducing an average compilation-time overhead of only 20\%.
%prototype introduces an average
%compilation-time overhead of only 20\%.
%Our optimization shows code-size reductions up to 22\%, with an overall average
%of about 5.6\%.
Coupled with profiling information, our optimization introduces no statistically
significant impact on performance.

For future work, we plan to focus on improving the ranking mechanism to reduce
compilation time.
We can achieve further improvements by integrating the
function-merging optimization to a summary-based parallel link-time optimization
framework, such as ThinLTO in LLVM.
We also plan to work on the linearization of the candidate functions, allowing
instruction reordering to maximize the number of matches between the functions.
